# What
Full screen widget with the entered text in large type.

# WHy
I loved this feature from my stint with Alfred on OSx, cmd+L would fill the screen with your current prompt. I've dabbled in other launchers to recreate this behaviour.

# Still, why
Oh yeah, to quickly share text with others when sitting close to people or when connected to a projector. For example my mailadress, somebody's phone number, a Wifi password, an url. Stuff like that where reading small type on a monitor isn't comfortable.
